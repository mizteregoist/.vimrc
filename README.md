# .vimrc
comfortable vim settings

first of all, you need to clone Vundle.vim into your .vim/bundle directory
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

and then:
```
git clone https://github.com/mizteregoist/vim-settings.git ~/vim-settings
cp -a ~/vim-settings/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

when you put these files on right places, do this command in vim:
```
:PluginInstall
```
